\description{
A sparse matrix (class "dgCMatrix") of single-cell transcriptomes
(scRNA-seq) for 600 cells and 20729 genes.
Single-cell UMI counts were normalized using a standard log-normalization:
counts for each cell were divided by the total counts for that cell and
multiplied by 10,000, then natural-log transformed using \code{log1p}. \cr\cr
This a subsample of T cells from the
large scRNA-seq PBMC dataset published
by \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.04.048}{Hao et al.} and
available as UMI counts at
